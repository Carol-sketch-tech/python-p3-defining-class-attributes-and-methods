# Defining Class Attributes and Class Methods

## Learning Goals

- Use class attributes and methods to write durable and powerful code.
  - Define class attributes and class methods.
  - Understand when, why, and how to use class attributes and class methods.
- Accomplish complex programming tasks using knowledge from previous modules.

## Key Vocab

- **Attribute**: variables that belong to an object.
- **Constant**: variable whose value cannot be changed.
- **Instance**: one specific working copy of a class. It is created when a
  class's `__init__` method is called.
- **Class**: a bundle of data and functionality. Can be copied and modified to
  accomplish a wide variety of programming tasks.
- **Static**: an attribute or method that cannot manipulate the class or
  instance it belongs to.
- **Exception**: an error that occurs during the execution of a program.
  Exceptions can be anticipated and handled without disrupting the execution of
  the program.

## Introduction

All objects are bundles of data and behavior — or attributes and methods. We
understand this to be true of instances of a class. Each instance contains
attributes or properties to store data, as well as methods that can enact
behaviors.

For example, let's say we have a class, `Album`. Every individual album instance
should have a release date attribute. To accomplish this, we'll define an
instance attribute, `self.release_date` that stores and makes this information
available.

```py
class Album:

    def __init__(self, date):
        self.release_date = date
```

Here we have an instance attribute, `self.release_date`, which can be accessed
through dot notation on the instance itself:

```py
album = Album(1991)
album.release_date
# => 1991
```

What you might not know, however, is that the **`Album` class itself is also an
object**. If our definition of an object is a bundle of code that contains
attributes and behaviors, then the entire `Album` class itself absolutely
qualifies.

The `Album` class can have its own attributes and methods. We call these class
attributes and class methods.

## Why Use Class Attributes and Methods

Let's say you wanted to keep a counter for how many albums you had in your music
collection. That way, you can brag to your friends about what a music aficionado
you are. The current code in our `Album` class has no way to keep such a count.
Looks like we will have to write some code to accommodate this new feature of
our program.

When it comes to adding new features or functionalities to our code, we start
out by asking a question: whose responsibility is it to enact this behavior or
functionality?

Right now, our program is pretty simple. We have an `Album` class and we have
album instances. So, is it the responsibility of an individual album to keep a
count of all of the other albums? Or is it the responsibility of the `Album`
class, which actually produces the individual albums, to keep a running count? I
think we can agree that it _isn't_ the job of the individual albums, but the job
of the `Album` class to keep a count of all of the instances it produces.

Now that we've decided whose job it is to enact the "keep a count of all albums"
behavior, we can talk about _how_ we enact that behavior.

We do so with the use of class attributes and methods. Our goal is to be able
to ask the `Album` class: "how many albums have you produced?" When we ask an
object to tell us something about itself, we use methods. It would be great if
we could do something like:

```py
Album.album_count
# => 0
```

...and return the number of existing albums. Let's build out this capability
now.

## Building Class Methods and Using Class Attributes

An **instance attribute** is responsible for holding information regarding an
_instance_. It is a variable that is available in **scope** for all instance
methods in the class.

A **class attribute** is accessible to the entire class — it has **class
scope**. A class method is a method that is called on the class itself, not on
the instances of that class.

Class attributes are typically used to store information regarding the class as
a whole and class methods enact behaviors that belong to the whole class, not
just to individual instances of that class.

### Defining a Class Attribute

A class attribute is declared using the same notation as anywhere else. We will
simply say `album_count = 0`.

What's important and what makes this a class attribute is where it is declared.
**A class attribute must be declared outside of any methods in the class.**

Let's create our class attribute now:

```py
class Album:
    
    album_count = 0

    def __init__(self, date):
        self.release_date = date
```

Great, now we have a class attribute to store our count of albums in. Since any
`Album` objects will be built from this class, we can access `album_count`
through the `Album` class or any `Album` objects that we instantiate using dot
notation.

```py
joshua_tree = Album(1987)
joshua_tree.album_count
# => 0
Album.album_count
# => 0
```

<details>

<summary><em>If we enter the code <code>Album.album_count += 1</code>,
what will <code>Album.album_count</code> become? How about
<code>joshua_tree.album_count</code>?</em></summary>

<p>
<h3>Both will equal <code>1</code>.</h3>

<p>When a Python class is modified, any objects that are instantiated from
the class or inherit from it will refer back to the class to retrieve the
values of any class attributes or methods.</p>
</p>
</details>
<br/>

The class attribute exists, but it should be updated whenever we add a new
album. Let's build on this class to make it a bit smarter.

### Manipulating Class Attributes From Instance Methods

Our `album_count` is stuck at `0`. When and how should we increment it? The
count of albums should go up as soon as a new album is created, or initialized.
We can hook into this moment in time in our `__init__` method:

```py
class Album:

    album_count = 0

    def __init__(self, date):
        Album.album_count += 1
        self.release_date = date
```

Here we are using the `album_count` class attribute, inside of our
`__init__` method, which is an instance method. We are saying: when a new
album is created, access the `album_count` class attribute and increment its
value by 1.

Using our class name and dot notation, we can access our class attributes
anywhere in our class: in both class and instance methods.

Now our code should behave in the following manner:

```py
Album()
Album()
Album()

Album.album_count
# 3
```

We've got an instance method set up now to manipulate our `album_count` class
attribute when we instantiate a new album. This is a very useful feature, but
what if we already have an album collection and want to manipulate the
`album_count` attribute without creating new `Album` objects?

### Defining a Class Method

A class method is defined like this:

```py
@classmethod
def class_method_name(cls):
    # some code
```

<details>

<summary><em>What is <code>@classmethod</code> telling the interpreter
to do?</em></summary>

<p>
<h3><code>@classmethod</code> is a decorator that adds functionality to the
method <code>class_method_name()</code>.</h3>

<p>Remember that methods are a type of function, and functions are first class
objects in Python. Decorators allow us to use our new function as an argument
and a return value to provide it some additional out-of-the-box functionality.
</p>
</p>

</details>
<br/>

Here, the `cls` keyword refers to the **entire class itself**, _not to an
instance of the class_. In this case, we are inside the class only, not inside
an instance method of that class. So, we are in the **class scope**, not the
instance scope.

Let's refactor our `Album` class so that `album_count` can be changed by the
class itself:

```py
class Album:

    album_count = 0

    def __init__(self, date):
        self.increase_album_count()
        self.release_date = date

    @classmethod
    def increase_album_count(cls, increment=1):
        cls.album_count += increment
```

Now we have an `Album` class that increases the number of albums as we get new
ones, but that does so through a method connected to the class itself rather
than new objects.

***

## Class Constants

One other type of variable that can be useful when building out classes is a
**class constant**. Class constants have a lot in common with class attributes.
Both constants and attributes:

- Are defined in the body of the class.
- Can be accessed from within a class method.
- Can be accessed from within an instance method.

A class constant looks a bit different than a class attribute. It's defined using
all capital letters, like so:

```py
class User:
    ROLES = ["Admin", "Moderator", "Contributor"]
```

When deciding when to use a class constant or a class attribute, the key
distinction is that class constants are used to store data that _doesn't
change_ (is constant), while class attributes are used to store data that does
change.

For example, we could define a list of valid genres for our album class using
a class constant:

```py
class Album:

    GENRES = ["Hip-Hop", "Pop", "Jazz"]
    album_count = 0

    def __init__(self, genre, date):
        if self.check_genre(genre):
            self.increase_album_count()
            self.genre = genre
            self.release_date = date

    @classmethod
    def check_genre(cls, genre):
        return genre in cls.GENRES

    @classmethod
    def increase_album_count(cls, increment=1):
        cls.album_count += increment
```

Scope-wise, class constants can _also_ be accessed from outside of the class
using this syntax:

```py
Album.GENRES
# => ["Hip-Hop", "Pop", "Jazz"]
```

Unlike in JavaScript, declaring a constant variable in Python doesn't actually
prevent the variable from being reassigned:

```py
Album.GENRES = "not a list anymore"
Album.GENRES
# => "not a list anymore"
```

However, declaring a variable with a constant is still a good indicator to other
developers that they _shouldn't_ reassign the variable's value.

***

## Conclusion

So far in our object-oriented Python code, we've focused on defining behavior
that is specific to an individual instance of a class using **instance
methods** and **instance attributes**. By also using **class methods**,
**class attributes**, and **class constants**, we can expand on our classes'
functionality by defining behavior that's not tied to one particular instance
of a class, but is related more generally to the class itself.
